16,TheTribal Kid,False,"A tip from a former activist. Stay low to avoid the excessive damage from shrapnels. Avoid rooms (except when it has a hallway, thick walls or when you fortify it) and do not lean against walls due too shock waves. Children often forget this and the results are beyond horrifying. Wear protective headgears or headphones and cover your face & neck with the correct placement of both hands and arms. Stop your car and hide as low as possible. Do not face towards the bomb except for your feets and stay away from windows. Make sure you are in posession of a first aid kit and flashlight. As a former activist for the opressed Palestinians & MENA I feel sorry for you. The adrenaline rush and terror like fear when bombs drop indiscriminately on civilians by the opressors is something very few of us will ever experience. These images still haunt me. Absolutely avoid being in the open because the last thing you want is a direct hit from the blast and check the Protection guide against Aerial Attacks. Flee as far away as possible from the blast radius. After the bombings there will most likely be an air and ground assault. Soldiers wil murder civilians, medical personel, journalists and activists. Depending on the importance of your country, the reliable sources will update the world about the status of war crimes. Top priority is surving the bombings and air assault. Do not be ashamed to flee your country with your family. I've seen many now and many before who had to do so, while the world watched and supported the slaughtering of those same people. Stay strong 👊🏾

However they surrounded Russia on all sides and wanted to turn Ukraine into a big military base and use cannon fodder. By the way, why are two brother peoples who share the same language and history and family and blood ties at war? That's exactly why. Has there been a lull in the conflict now and what did (NATO and US) do? Did they exhaustively try to reach a peace agreement? No. They sent tons of missiles and weapons to the Ukrainians. Literally they said: - you and the Russians together blow each other up. You must fight to the death. I wonder where the policy of peaceful conflict resolution is. Where's the brotherhood? And where they want to go. Because Russians and Europeans had the same traumatic past in common and could be friends. However what is the future being built by creating a nuclear power as an enemy. Annihilation? If Europe continues to listen to the US, focused on fomenting conflicts and concerned with selling weapons, it will end up reaping this: war. Peaceful conflict resolution. People's self-determination. Mutual respect. Non-belligerent politics. This is the way.

598,Direktor SEO,False,"Why do I have the right to say that it is on the hands of the United States that the blood of all those killed in today's conflict in Ukraine lies.
1. The USA has been reviving Nazism in Ukraine since 1991, because it is profitable and can be used against Russia, this is a fact, Soros sponsored the writing and distribution of textbooks that Ukrainian children are now studying, Nazi heroes such as Bandera and Shukhevych are extolled there, these are policemen in the service of Hitler who advocated the independence of Ukraine, historical facts state that the Germans themselves were amazed at their cruelty in the massacre of civilians supporting Soviet partisans, if someone was caught, they destroyed the entire village where he lived old women of ALL. They drove into the barn, locked it up and set it on fire. ""Volyn Massacre"" well describes the Ukrainian insurgent army of those times, which is now being glorified. Bandera is the official national hero in Ukraine.
Thanks to Soros, they are now national heroes of Ukraine.
2. The United States staged a bloody coup d'etat in 2014, which ultimately led to the current consequences, Ukraine lost Crimea due to a coup d'etat and a civil war began
3. The most important fact that allows us to blame the United States for the current conflict that is currently going on in Ukraine: Zelensky was forced to provoke Putin to aggression, why and why? Elementary, Biden and many European puppet leaders declared that Putin would attack before February 20, he did not attack, moreover, he withdrew troops from the border, exposing Biden and all his puppets to ridicule and in order to justify himself to the electors and not look ridiculous, Biden ordered to provoke Putin. It is easy to do this, Putin is a man who keeps his word, he stated that if Ukraine starts active hostilities against Donbass again, Russia will have to recognize and defend itself, and they took advantage of this. yes! There are honest and fair people in Russia who are used to being responsible for their words, not like in the USA, Britain and Europe, and this often plays against Russia, but the sense of justice among Russians is embedded in the subconscious and when they see not justice, the hand itself reaches for a weapon.",2022-02-26 07:23:36.932488,0,False,0,[]

876,SamuraiBirds,False," @Mike G   @Mike G  Here's my tip. The use of illegal weapons on civilians: white phosphurus, butterfly bullets and DIME (Amnesty - Haaretz). The illegal use of sniper units on non-combatants (Amnesty - OHCHR). The deliberate murder of children, medics, journalists and photographers who wore reflective vests and PRESS signs (CPJ - Reuters). The illegal detention of women and children under a military court, including abuse and interrogation techniques (UNICEF - Defense for Children Palestine). Illegal open-fire orders from Israeli officials also firing live ammo during protests where there was no direct threat (Btselem - HRW). 50+ racist laws against Palestinians/Arabs within the Israeli borders (Anadolu Agency). Restricting the import and export of goods by land, air and sea as well as electricity (Amnesty - HRW). Denying human rights bodies entry to the OPT (Occupied Palestinian Territory), including the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the OPT as well as ICC on investigations (ICC - Amnesty - France24). Destroying buildings in which the media houses then not being able to provide evidence (DW - Reuters). Moving in settlers through the approval of your own court therefore displacing civilians and systematically occupying/seizing land where families live who have multiple generations tracing back (Amnesty - OHCHR - UN). Illegal torture of prisoners including children with regard to beating, painful chaining, sleep deprivation and use of stress positions (Amnesty - UNICEF). Rejection of medical assistance in situations where Palestinians were injured during police activities (Amnesty - OHCHR - HRW). Firing missiles in densely populated areas. (Amnesty - HRW, look at the comparison of deaths between the 2 sides and you'll see that its not a war). Lying politicians (Netanyahu who lies and Naftali Bennet who used the wrong photos on Instagram trying to blame Palestine. Using video's of Iraq and photo of Pakistan. Using old video's and misleading evidence while providing insufficient evidence. Provide protection to Jewish settlers and benefits, Palestinians in same neighbourhood can't have. (Haaretz - Btselem - Amnesty). Deliberately targetting hospitals and ambulances (HRW- Fred Abrahams: Israel not able to provide convincing evidence). Search and arrest operations with excessive use of power. (Amnesty - Badil). Renouncing right to nationality due to discriminatory law of entry to Israel (NGO report to UN). James Miller, the cameraman who was shot during a documentary. Razan Al Najjar, the medic whos video was edited by the IDF and while she evacuated wounded they shot her. Rachel Corrie, the activist who was crushed by an IDF bulldozer. Tristan Anderson, the photojournalist who was shot in the head with a high velocity tear-gas projectile (injured). Brian Avery, the medic who was shot in the face (injured). Sajid Muzher, the medic who was shot in the abdomen. Thomas Hurndall, the activist who was shot in the head by a sniper. Tarek Loubani, the medic who was shot in both legs (injured). Musa Abu Hassanin, the paramedic who was shot. Ahmed Abu Hussein, the photojournalist who was shot in the abdomen. Basil Ibrahim Faraj, a cameraman who suffered injuries from a airstike then died. Abdullah Qutati, a medic who was shot. Fadel Shana, cameraman death. Ayman Abu Al Ouf, doctor and 12 family members death. Issam Tilawi, journalist death. Abu Zahra, photographer death. Mooein Ahmad al Aloul, doctor death. Yaser Murtaja, photographer death and the list goes on. The most renowned defenders of the Palestinian struggle are Nelson Mandela, Stephen Hawking, Sigmund Freud, Noam Chomsky, Isaac Asimov, Norman Finkelstein, Emma Marc Lamont and others. Marc Lamont states that the term Anti-Semitism should be redefined. Arabs are semetic as well. All Human Right Organizations including the UN, Btselem and The Jeruzalem Post are against the apartheid state. Even soldiers have come forward (Breaking the Silence) to admit that they were war criminals. Palestinians have the right under International Law to armed defense under occupation, don't forget that the West confirms that. Everyone with a normal working brain understands why the U.S. supports Israel by any means neccesary. There are enough sources that can tell you more if you are willing to learn from professional bureau's which register the deaths of journalists to organizations which represent former IDF soldiers. Have you actually truly researched the amounts of deaths between the two sides?",2022-02-25 07:23:42.159710,17,False,0,[]

My only concern is for the citizens who never wanted war, but they are affected by it nonetheless. Whoever preaches to continue the conflict is no good either. I think the Ukrainian forces should lay down their arms and let the events play out for now because they will lose regardless of what they do. After the conflict is done, they should negotiate with Putin and take a vote for the Ukrainian citizens that want sovereignty. If Putin still refuses, then that is a good reason to go to war.

Many politicians fit that description. The problem is when Putin starts to get bored. He has already achieved everything he wanted, but the story is missing. In principle, he made sense to pressure NATO so that it does not approach the borders. But gobbling up a country of 44 million people has been an act of megalomania, which is getting out of hand. Putin's threat to Sweden and Finland, if they join NATO, serves to cover up the feeling that Russia cannot win the Ukraine war if it lasts more than a fortnight. Even conquering Kiev, there will always be hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians doing acts of sabotage. If NATO proceeds to manufacture Stinger-type missiles and introduce them in Ukraine, Russian casualties will be unbearable, with Russia's economy in decline. NATO could also have declared out loud: ""Ukraine will never join NATO, let's sign a pact to respect the Minks agreements, so that Russia does not feel threatened and does not enter Ukraine either. We want Russia's prosperity."" . But 4,000 military and political advisers are useless.

Come on, they knew very well that this was a way of getting these same nations to be dependents on them and also granting them servitude during the Cold war. But, i'm not here to change your mind the US is not a victim and Russia is not a victim the only victims are the innocent people dying because of these governments interests. Let's see  how the  next chapters of these great nations saviors of the world ( US, Russia and China ) is going to look like.

1922,Angler Gin,False,"Since November 2021, the United States and its allies have been howling, shouting, crying, gossiping and shrieking that Russia will invade Ukraine. Now Russia is declaring a military operation in Ukraine.

Most of us do not know Russia and Ukraine's history. But it might help to know that the Ukrainian and the Russian people share the same history, culture, language and ancestry. They brothers and cousins sharing the same blood in their veins.

Think of people from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao: This is how close Russians and Ukrainians are. Both sharing same ancestors, language and culture.

After the USSR was disbanded some 30 years ago, the Western capitalists started Infiltrating neighboring countries of Russia. Among them was Ukraine. The US and NATO then installed puppet politicians and oligarchs just like how they did it to The Philippines and most African and South American countries.

Now the US wants to recruit Ukraine to NATO and put up Military base in there. A base with nuclear bombs right at the backyard of Russia. If you are Putin, would you allow it?

Remember JFK? Back in 1962, the US barricaded Cuba when the USSR put up long-range missiles in there.

Putin, a Military man himself and President of Russia is not a mad man. He is defending his country from the evils who are making this world a hard place to live.

In fact, Putin and Russia could be saving Ukraine like a little brother. It's because Ukraine is now marred with rebellions and separatists inside its territory since Western oligarchs infiltrated the country. Ukraine has been a battle field since 2014 but the world almost never heard about it. Just search ""Donbass War"" to understand what I mean.

Putin and Russia has every right to stop the US and its allies making Ukraine a US Military base. Because where ever there's a US Military base, chaos is almost certain. War, famine, bombing and terrorism always follows where these American Soldiers go. Ukrainians are now suffering as we speak.             

Many of its people are begging Russia to intervene because the US and NATO are making it a chaotic place just like Middle East.                                          

People who watch Pro-western Media don't know about this. But where ever there is war and terrorism, US and Brits will exploit it for profit.

Our world history are full of Lies from the very beginning. Most local heroes who defended their lands, their people, their culture and their way of life were demonized and called mad men by western colonizers.

Most European countries have their share of invading and killing millions of Africans, Asians, native Australians and native Americans in the last 600 years. That's all in the name of greed and expansionism.

But the Russians? They stayed inside their boundaries. They fought in World War 1 and 2 but they went back home after the war. Russians are peaceful people. But they are brave when provoked and will fight to death.

The greed of US and its allies knows no bound. They are poking the Big Bear. Now that Putin and the Russian people are taking action, let's see how tough the US and British Military are. Will they meddle? Or they will just complain and whine and threaten Russia with sanctions?

My take is that, the Brits and US Army won't dare a Military confrontation. They only bully weaker countries with no nukes.

The real villains are those greedy dung-eaters who wants to put down Russia. Because Russia possesses the biggest land area in the world rich in oil and mineral deposits.

Putin, the Russian People and its country is the only nation not invaded and controlled by the British Empire, the US and its allies. They are humanity's last hope. Putin and Russia must defend their land and people at every cost.",2022-02-26 07:24:17.037632,1,True,1,[1939]

Those that wield power will be consumed by it eventually just learn from Germany there's only so much power that you can control and after that power will take over and you will lose this game because anyone that has grabbed the power they will always lose their sanity while doing it.

This war with Russia it's about the land at the end of the day it's about taking the lands he wants Ukraine as a whole. And now I won't be surprised if this will now trigger a cause-and-effect North Korea now might want to take over South Korea it will come as this is happening they're hungry for power.

2053,StofStuiver,False," @B__W_45  You cant. Youve probably heard the term 'information warfare'.
That always existed of course (which is why the official narratives on historical events from the last century are also not what they say it is). However, with modern technology (also monitoring how people react to things... they have actually psychologists and so working for them) creating much more means to control public opinion, we are now in full information warfare. So you cannot trust any news outlet blindly.

Its a bit hard to explain how to reach truth, but in general:
- It helps if you are well educated in many fields.
- Be sceptical of any information given by people with an interest (any sort of interest, but especially those who directly benefit financially)
- Be aware of what you react emotional to, (specially shocking events), bc at that time the brain is very open to suggestion. It seeks an explanation and is inclined to take the first one that comes along, that is comfortable (fits in their pre existing moral beliefs). This is the basis of 'psy ops'. So whenever you see something, like now in Ukrain, that makes you emotional (fear, shock, over the moon happy, nervous, etc), take a step back and think about what youve just seen. Then consider if you are capable at this time to weigh information correctly. If you think you can, go on. If you think you cannot, you should not watch any more, bc you will be told a lie and accept it.
- It helps a lot in knowing history. The more you know about history, the more you understand where things are coming from.
- it helps a lot if are pragmatic in analysing data. Can separate obvious truth from fiction. Etc.
- Always look at differing sources. The more, the better.
- Try to get real data (scientific data)
- Know that ALL audio and video can be faked in the present day and age. Go to the movies to see what they can make you see as real and realize what they show you is not possible. What are the give aways in such a piece of video? How do they do it? What are the signs that some video is false? Same for audio. In general they shorter a segment, the more cut off it is., the more shady it is, the less reliable it is. Also as for video watch for inconsistencies in fragments. CGI is computer created and it gets better all the time. You have to learn what is possible and what is not, in order ro recognice fakes.
- Know that at this time, certain parties have been using fake (psy op), propaganda at every step of the way.
- Always 'follow the money'. Who benefits from what?

Many more things and not in the least it also helps to train logical thinking, psychology (what is normal behavior in a given situation), etc etc.
I hope this helps you...

As an example
The US blew up (probably) their own ship the USS Maine, in the port of Havana, to be able to declare war on Spain. Of course this wasnt known at the time. But it could have been known that it was dubious and some probably did. and that is because, who was at the time the weaker state, pretty much unable to wage war against the US in Cuba, would have no benefit from blowing up the ship at all. The US however did.
Many years later it seemed the Spanish already had decided that they could never wage war against the US and tried everything to prevent it. This became clear from internal documents made prior to the event, that were much later released.
The US staged many of such false flags and psy ops. One you probably know is 911. Did any arab state, or 'terrorist' org win anything with that? Nope. Who did win? Well the US criminals on top. (and in Europe). It was the kickstart of a multi billion/trillion world wide enterprise taking away rights of peoples and even leading to Iraq war 2. (where no wmd's were ever found)
Remember the line ""they took the babies from the incubators and threm them on the floor"" ? That was the daughter of a high state politicians, that had taken acting lessons. And ofc it turned out later to be all lies. But people were ofcourse shocked at the time. What an animals those Iraqis were! But the real animals are the people making up such lies.

You will later on today (even now started, bbc showing apartment buildings that were alledgedly rocket striked, blaming Russia, but if you hold the video and look closely at what you can actually see, does this look like inhabited buildings that were struck, or buildings ready for demolition where 2 fire truck are attempting to put out an invisible fire?)
So later today you will see white helmet reports/videos of civilian victims that were killed by Russians ofc. (as if any soldiers leaves behind a nametag after he kills). Those videos were already made.

Look at what BIDEN DID IN AFGHANISTAN. I WOULD HATE TO SEE OUR MEN AND WOMEN SCREWED OVER, OR OUR OWN LIVES ENDANGERED should other players be involved  at a time when AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS WEAK AND UNTRUSTWORTHY. WE MAY OF HAD A GOOD MILITARY, WE MAY STILL HAVE., BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMPETENT LEADER THAT UNDERSTANDS HOW TO WEILD AND ORGANIZE IT. You should know first what OTHER POTENTIAL ENEMIES ARE INVOLVED . OUR NATION IS DIVIDED AT PRESENT. I’m all for support, but I’m smart enough to understand that there is more to the story. I hate to see war happen period. There is a bigger picture at play that could play out very badly should we engage our military. This is bad for Ukraine, but all has not been revealed. I am happy to see nations stepping up and showing their disproval of what PUTIN IS DOING. IT IS HONORABLE TO SEE THEM TRYING TO MANEUVER PUTIN WITH WHATEVER FINANCIAL STRONG HOLDS THEY CAN PUT IN PLACE, BUT TO ENGAGE MILITARILY COULD PROVE TO BE CATASTROPHIC FOR OUR OWN. IT IS VERY WELL POSSIBLE THAT CHINA IS SIDE BY SIDE WITH RUSSIA AS WELL AS KOREA. THOSE THREE HAVE BEEN CHOMPING AT THE BIT FOR OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE AGAINST AMERICANS. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE BEEN BUILDING MORE MILITARY FORCE WITHOUT STOP? THE US IS AT IT WEAKEST AT PRESENT AND VIEWED BY OTHER NATIONS AS SUCH, GIVEN OUR EMBARRASSMENT OF CURRENT LEADERSHIP, OR THE LACK THERE OF. I FEEL FOR THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE, BUT I ALSO VALUE THEM OUR OWN LIVES AND FAMILIES. WE COULD END UP IN A WORSE SITUATION THAN WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING HAPPENING TO THEM. SHOULD THERE BE UNSPOKEN ALLIANCES. I SHUTTER TO THINK. IF WE WERE STRONG , IF WE HAD A RESPECTABLE, TRUSTWORTHY, KNOWLEDGEABLE LEADER, I WOULD DEFINITELY HOPE TO SEE MILITARY SUPPORT.

WE COULD ALL LOSE  BADLY. WELL, ITS VERY POSSIBLE THAT WE WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. ESPECIALLY IF CHINA IS INVOLVED. KOREA WOULD DEFINITELY JUMP IN . THE WORLD IS A TINDER BOX RIGHT NOW AND MANY NATIONS ARE ALREADY AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. WE COULD NOT TAKE THAT ON . WE MAY NOT EVEN BE A LE TO HANDLE RUSSIA ALONE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. PUTIN HASNT THREW ALL HE HAS AT UKRAIN. HE ISNT COMING OUT WITH EVERYTHING TO MANEUVER A SMALLER NATION AS UKRAIN. UKRAIN WITH GODS PROTECTION, IF IT HIS WILL COULD COME OUT VICTORIOUS. MIRACLES CAN AND HAVE HAPPENED WHEN GOD GETS INVOLVED. I AM JUST HIGHLY CONCERNED AT WHAT ELSE IS REALLY GOING ON HERE.

Russia was busy encircling and gobbling up Eastern Europe at a stellar pace at close of WWII after the ""Nazi threat"" was long gone.  This was the only reason NATO was formed in the first place was a much delayed response to control brutal Soviet expansionism.  Putin even trumpeted this nonsensical ""Nazi"" threat just recently.  Do I have to remind you that the U.S. was also fighting Nazis in WWII?  And what about Stalin murdering at least 6 million of his own people?  Did any American president do that?  Oh, did I forget to mention that except for a few plutocrats, Russians live like crap compared to Western Europeans?

2463,Janelle,False,"-I perceive that initially, when conflicts arise, there are levels of fear and wrath... in moments of the fear and wrath of deceit of promises and expectations.
When in actuality, parentgae influences of reason or thought process, do actually have an impact upon, self moral interpretation.
And actual dictate within ourselves, our personal decree of capacity for a level of rightful honesty, that can potentially affect the outcomes of tempered psycho-social proper mediation.
Threat, does and can equal potential action, for defensive purposes of protection.

I did send an email of complaint, about Russias  treatment of their children, and the lack of humanity in this.  As an after revelation, these children were momentarily exposed to American families, whether they had in fact persisted adoption... if that was an option.
A section of these children, in facilities of isolated neglect, were developmentally injured.  Because of bomb radiation.  The humane care, was in fact, for some of the facilities to group these children together.  In a sort of school of special needs.  Where the recovery chances were not an option.
So in this measure.  Some American families did seek to try and reprieve some of these children, in a sort of, more humane life.  To have access to a home with regular activities.
However, with very severe cases of permanent disabilities, the neccessity of care would not effect the outcome.  Any more than, lessening the strain of the impact of their disability, if they did not have peers and belonging.  Whom required the same care.
You understand what I mean?

So here, within other areas, I witness that Russia has in fact the advantage of belonging.  As do many other countries.  Over the history of North American current continent of an evolved nation, that still have resonating residuals of resentment.  With Native Reservations, and immigration slavery, from an aging population.  50 years ago.  Where segregation conditioning laws, enforced these very quick measures over a mediation of communication.
As a democratic country.  We easily rear our disappointment in our indifferences.
But there are actually long standing countries, with the long term responsibilities to resolute over population and language preservation.
These do seem the be very very rigid points, of outdated beliefs, because of the violence that threatens free will educational knowledge.  And in degrees of the fear of authoritative deceit, within regular day greed and corruption, that cannot be proven in daily living judicial court of law.  It is a very unfair, and hurtful shot of loss, in unjust grief.... the baddies are taking everything we believe in and worked so hard for.  And we can't do nothing!

Well, cycles of generational family violence, and family vows of silence, do hold loved ones back from getting help.
There are addicts and criminals, in life! Pedophiles and scam artists.  So how many if these people, need help and trust to understand how to get the system to work for them?  How many people need medical treatment and psychology, so they can make those leaps of faith, that will better their lives and continue on the save others?

I'm not saying any of the global issues in each country, is ok, or that there shouldn't be mentally capacitive reasoning for a divine intervention of sorts.
But I am saying theres a bigger picture, above our own fears and anger, that never changes.... despite whatever pressures and health problems.
There is a level of truth.
And in reality, there are people that cannot and will not handle that!
Whether it's a group, or a religion sought by man, the truth is evasive when a nation is divided!
One day, even divine interventions, will need scrutiny and improvement.
But, before that day.... communication with differences will come first!
If you cannot understand your health, and you cannot reason with yourself... will you be able to reason with others?  Specifically will you reason about God, or with God... and the real truth about all these thine things?

2784,Momento de paz,False,"Listening to the US President talking about peace and the defense of Democracy without analyzing the chronology of the facts can even convince (the layman). The USSR ended in 1991 but for the US the NATO war machine could not stop. They buy weapons and fund projects that help US astronomical spending. Like the F-35 (American tax dredge). However they surrounded Russia on all sides and wanted to turn Ukraine into a big military base and use cannon fodder. By the way, why are two brother peoples who share the same language and history and family and blood ties at war? That's exactly why. Has there been a lull in the conflict now and what did (NATO and US) do? Did they exhaustively try to reach a peace agreement? No. They sent tons of missiles and weapons to the Ukrainians. Literally they said: - you and the Russians together blow each other up. You must fight to the death. I wonder where the policy of peaceful conflict resolution is. Where's the brotherhood? And where they want to go. Because Russians and Europeans had the same traumatic past in common and could be friends. However what is the future being built by creating a nuclear power as an enemy. Annihilation? If Europe continues to listen to the US, focused on fomenting conflicts and concerned with selling weapons, it will end up reaping this: war. Peaceful conflict resolution. People's self-determination. Mutual respect. Non-belligerent politics. This is the way. Still from this perspective, it is obvious that if it were in the interest to help Ukraine economically and socially, there would already be a rich and prosperous nation here.

 certainty that Allaah will achieve His purpose even if He had to annihilate half of mankind who reached their rectitude so that they submit to Allaah's caliph and servant Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. So let each human flee to Ar-Rahman (Arabic: the Most Gracious) my Lord and your Lord; Allaah who there is no god except Him, my Lord and your Lord, and Lord of the heavens and earth and what is between them and Lord of the Great Throne. Also, know that Allaah Forgives all sins without exception; He is indeed the All-Forgiving the Most Merciful. And turn to Allaah in repentance from the great sins, injustice, and gross indecencies and flee from Allaah to Him I am indeed from Him to you a manifest warner and the decision neither belongs to me nor you. Know that Everything to do with this affair is in Allaah's hands and all matters return to Allaah (in decision) who Knows the treachery of the eyes and what chests conceal.

And my call has not increased wrongdoers among you except in denial of Allaah Lord of the worlds, and you neglected Allaah as if He is not the One behind the cosmic war, the so-called climatic, aerial, nautical, and terrestrial disasters! But they are due to the approach of the planet of torment (Saqar), and I have warned you of severe punishment from Allaah but you refused as if He is not the One behind His cosmic war and the war of His covidious soldiers! Glorified and highly Exalted is He above what you associate with Him! If Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani is truly Allaah's caliph on the whole world, know that Allaah will achieve His purpose and know that He is Capable of everything
Also, How many times did I warn you that you must worship Allaah my Lord and your Lord with insight (the Quran) from Allaah Lord of the worlds and that you must fear His torment through the piety of your hearts out of fear of Allaah the One, Exalted is He! He is indeed Worthy to be feared, and Worthy to forgive, but you feel secure against the plan of Allaah and only the losers feel secure against Allaah’s plan
And I have already written to you a healing prayer for people in general in a statement on 26th of Ramadan 1441AH (19-05-2020AD), titled: Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement
So read the whole prayer in it in the evening and in the morning, and know that therein is healing for what is in the chests. It also has the complete and conclusive solution for what you are experiencing of Allaah's cosmic and covidious war. O Allaah I have delivered so be my Witness and if you were arrogant towards this prayer, why should I grieve for people who are arrogant and wrongdoers?! Verily, judgment belongs to Allaah the Swiftest in account and planning; indeed He is the best of Judges

And I have already written to you a healing prayer for people in general in a statement on 26th of Ramadan 1441AH (19-05-2020AD), titled: Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement
So read the whole prayer in it in the evening and in the morning, and know that therein is healing for what is in the chests. It also has the complete and conclusive solution for what you are experiencing of Allaah's cosmic and covidious war. O Allaah I have delivered so be my Witness and if you were arrogant towards this prayer, why should I grieve for people who are arrogant and wrongdoers?! Verily, judgment belongs to Allaah the Swiftest in account and planning; indeed He is the best of Judges
Peace be upon the messengers and praise be to Allaah Lord of the worlds

If Article 5 of the NATO Charter doesn’t mean anything then each and every one of the small European nations better develop nuclear weapons, because that is the only thing that will stop Russia without NATO support.

2840,yemen $$,False,"O human populations, the severe corona is a firm plan from Allaah who has Sent it to whoever disobeys the orders of Allaah generally, to submit and obey the command of His caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. Verily, whoever disobeys my order give him tidings of clinical death through a plan from He who has Appointed me His caliph on the worlds (Allah my Lord and your Lord) and there is no escape! Who is it that is coequal to Allah Lord of the worlds Glorified and Highly Exalted is He ?!
Omicron would accept the truce of whoever obeys Allah and His caliph; for peace is best. But if you refused, soon a lot of nations will find themselves without presidents nor governments, and I will not allow any chaos between nations when they have no governments, as omicron will strike down whoever wants to cause corruption in the land by taking away people's money and business or violate their sanctities, verily omicron will knock him down immediately and will severely strike at every finger-joint of him to keep people's security after (Allaah) annihilates those who refused and acted arrogantly towards the command of Allaah the One the Overpowering to obey His caliph (as what has passed is not but mere warning and alarm of widespread evil) and he will never find anyone to protect him from the torment of Allaah's firm plan. How many times did I advise decision-makers at day and night to be servants of Allaah and to worship Allaah alone no partners with Him so they obey the command of Allaah's caliph on the worlds (who is Allaah's servant like them) so they submit to the command of Allaah's caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani
O Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, I swear by Him who has appointed me as His caliph; that is Allaah who you deny Him (my Lord and your Lord) if you did not release all Muslims inside the prisons of China along with all prisoners in general in the Chinese prisons, the firm plan of Allah, COVID, will strike you down along with all wrongdoers among your soldiers, like it (COVID) did to Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud
O Xi Jinping, Bin Salman did not break his appointment out of his own accord but COVID; the firm plan of Allah has stricken him down into a clinical death like I had promised him before. And I have promised you with it, O Xi Jinping, along with those of your like in the worlds
Go and ponder upon: (The Series of Statements About the Blood Gnat),
and whoever wants to understand the news let him read it from the beginning to the end and that is for you to know that Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani truly knows from Allah that which you do not know, and those who understand and think know that Allaah has truly Appointed him His caliph on the whole world
 certainty that Allaah will achieve His purpose even if He had to annihilate half of mankind who reached their rectitude so that they submit to Allaah's caliph and servant Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. So let each human flee to Ar-Rahman (Arabic: the Most Gracious) my Lord and your Lord; Allaah who there is no god except Him, my Lord and your Lord, and Lord of the heavens and earth and what is between them and Lord of the Great Throne. Also, know that Allaah Forgives all sins without exception; He is indeed the All-Forgiving the Most Merciful. And turn to Allaah in repentance from the great sins, injustice, and gross indecencies and flee from Allaah to Him I am indeed from Him to you a manifest warner and the decision neither belongs to me nor you. Know that Everything to do with this affair is in Allaah's hands and all matters return to Allaah (in decision) who Knows the treachery of the eyes and what chests conceal. Indeed Allaah is Capable of everything, and know that all things and all which has hit you are a determined decree in the Book Inscribed
How many times did I warn you that you cannot resist Allaah's cosmic and covidious war, but you acted arrogantly! And my call has not increased wrongdoers among you except in denial of Allaah Lord of the worlds, and you neglected Allaah as if He is not the One behind the cosmic war, the so-called climatic, aerial, nautical, and terrestrial disasters! But they are due to the approach of the planet of torment (Saqar), and I have warned you of severe punishment from Allaah but you refused as if He is not the One behind His cosmic war and the war of His covidious soldiers! Glorified and highly Exalted is He above what you associate with Him! If Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani is truly Allaah's caliph on the whole world, know that Allaah will achieve His purpose and know that He is Capable of everything
Also, How many times did I warn you that you must worship Allaah my Lord and your Lord with insight (the Quran) from Allaah Lord of the worlds and that you must fear His torment through the piety of your hearts out of fear of Allaah the One, Exalted is He! He is indeed Worthy to be feared, and Worthy to forgive, but you feel secure against the plan of Allaah and only the losers feel secure against Allaah’s plan

From the Ancient Semitic Scroll: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”:
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

If you walk the streets of Moscow, you will eventually smell the faint odor of gasoline.

Any crimp on Russia’s ability to access the European market is a threat to its economic security.

To get it there, Russia relies mostly on two aging pipeline networks, one of which runs through Belarus and the other through Ukraine. For this, Russia pays Ukraine around $2 billion a year in transit fees.

Russia is a petrostate and relies on oil and natural-gas sales for about 60% of its export revenue and 40% of its total budget expenditures. Any crimp on Russia’s ability to access the European market is a threat to its economic security.

As Ukrainians looked to rising living standards in places like Poland and Latvia that had joined NATO and the European Union, many wondered why they couldn’t have the same for themselves.

This is where Putin’s nationalistic impulses kick in. He views the fall of the Soviet Union as the “greatest geopolitical tragedy” of the past century and the rush of  former Eastern bloc countries into the embrace of the European Union, and even NATO, as a great humiliation.

He has drawn a line in the sand with countries that border Russia, invading Georgia in 2008 when it hinted at joining NATO, and moving to destabilize Ukraine when it moved to establish closer economic ties with Europe.

Domestically, Putin has sold the incursions into Ukraine on purely nationalistic grounds — even going so far this weekend as to dismiss Ukraine’s history as an independent country as a falsehood.

I'm struggling to find anything that's criminating towards the Ukraine.

My problem with getting your sources from RT News is that it's Russian. If you are going to get your news from one of the countries involved in the conflict it's most likely going to be heavily bias and you'd need to compare it to the other side to really draw out what's happening.

Best way we can get a proper view on what's happening is to look at multiple different country news sources. I've been looking at India, Australia, UK, U.S and Russian news and it really just seems like Russia wants resources which it can't get but needs, has been trying to take over Ukraine for very long time now with threats against joining NATO for Ukraine and has recently threatened the world with nuclear weapons.

But then again, I'm not in either of these countries and I don't know anyone in these countries so it's not like I can check facts against what they are experiencing either.  I've just got to take everything with a grain of salt.

3217,ا Grignwan Zikaln,False,"O Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Aal-Saud, I am fed up with my patience on you having imprisoned my supporters and on top of them Abdul Aziz Mohy Meshref Al-Shahhari, in the prisons of KSA for more than three years. And I, Allaah's caliph, Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, am not begging you O Mohammed Bin Salman to free them but I am indeed commanding you to decree an order to set them all free urgently without delay; in addition to, compensating them financially for imprisoning them without any right. But because they are among the supporters of Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani who calls for worshipping Allaah alone no partners with Him, removing man's injustice to his fellow man, and achieving global peace between populations, along with peaceful coexistence between Muslims and non-Muslims. Certainly, whoever opposes me in this is opposing Allaah, His messengers, and His caliph
O Mohammed Bin Salman and his allies, Allaah Has Ordered me to say the following to whoever opposes Allaah and His caliph:
(What is your thought about Whom Allaah is with Him). And O Mohammed Bin Salman, release my Saudi and Non-Saudi supporters from the prisons of KSA, and beware of Allaah's planning and know with knowledge of certainty that whoever defies Allaah and His caliph; indeed Allaah will severely torment him. Moreover, all the worlds will surely know that the best outcome is for the righteous and the earth belongs to Allaah and He grants it to whomever He chooses of His servants. Also, people altogether will know that Allaah will achieve His will if Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani was truly Imam Mahdi; Allaah's caliph on the worlds. Verily, if I am a liar, it will be to my own loss and no harm shall befall you. And we will wait and see as Judgment belongs to Allaah, the Swiftest in planning and accounting
O Mohammed Bin Salman, you and your likes among Arab and Non-Arab and all those who arrested my supporters in KSA along with all those who judged on them in aggression without any right, will know that all power belongs to Allaah. We will see what Allaah, the Severe in Punishment shall do to them and you surely will not avail them anything against Allaah's torment. And I will not launch against you any missiles from Yemen as I do not own them and they belong to Houthis and I do not need their assistance at all, as Allaah will direct against you and your likes in the worlds a severe in might COVID and will increase it in ferocity making it a new COVID by Allaah's words of Power [the word ""be"" so it is]; firm planning by Allaah, to invade the chests of wrongdoers as well as yours, o Mohammed Bin Salman. Since it is dedicated to all those who defy Allaah and His caliph among decision-makers in different countries in the worlds, as a result, Allaah will annihilate them by a command from Him or severely torment them until whenever He Pleases. Indeed He is the Most Knowing and Most Wise and to Him, all matters return in decision
On the other hand, whoever repents and turns to his Lord to Guide his heart and Forgive his sins to worship Allaah alone no partners with Him, and submit to Allaah's caliph on the worlds; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani in obedience to Allaah my Lord and your Lord, will definitely find Allaah All-Forgiving and Most Merciful
So flee from Allaah to Him, indeed I am a clear warner from Him to You. And worship Him alone no partners with Him as verily I am a clear warner from Him to you. Also, call upon Him alone no partners with Him, and do not call anyone else besides Him as certainly, I am a manifest warner from Him to you. O Allaah I have delivered so be my Witness
Peace be upon the messengers and praise to Allaah Lord of the worlds...
Allaah's caliph and servant; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani
