0,"Here's another perspective. I saw this in the Washington Post today in the Outlook section which was written by Ian Garner, who's a scholar studying memory of war in Putin's Russia. It's talking about how the war is going for Putin on social media. Some choice quotes here:One on government messaging:Today, state social media and television channels are working overtime to present an unchallenged narrative of righteousness. Yet the government’s messaging is impersonal, abstract and unappealing. On widely watched political shows — which now seem to be airing around the clock — and on the popular Telegram channels of news organizations such as RIA Novosti, Russians are being bombarded with ahistoric screeds about the country’s anti-imperialist intentions. TV presenters make wild boasts about Russia’s nuclear superiority over NATO.And on the newspapers there.Newspaper articles focus on hyperbolic claims that a war-hungry West is out for ethnic Russian blood: “The West needs a depopulated Ukraine,” reads one headline in Pravda. The country’s leaders, when they deign to appear on TV via prerecorded appearances, are presented in isolation, conversing with each other in rococo czarist palaces or lifeless rooms deep inside the Kremlin. While the sense of war pervades this media space, it is never named as such: The conflict is supposedly between the West, which has insidiously spread anti-Russian and “fascist” oppression, and the innocent people of Ukraine; Russia and its armies are absent from the battlefield.And then it talks about VK, the state sponsored social media. Users of VK overwhelmingly support the war. A glance at VK, which claims to have 97 million active users and has been controlled by Putin allies since 2014, reveals the nature of this support. In this state-controlled sphere, the war is most conspicuous by its absence. Entering the phrase “#нетвойне” — “no to the war,” a popular slogan with more than 430,000 mentions on Instagram — in the search box on VK led to just 1,700 results on Tuesday. Almost all were pro-war. Some were downright frightening, parroting a hyperbolic version of the government’s narrative: “Today I want to write about the f*****s who’ve decided that Russia invaded Ukraine … you absolute b*stards, Russian soldiers are saving people!!!” Antiwar messages, when they are posted, simply disappear from the platforms — removed by humans or by algorithms.Even a statement, like what Ovi made to our media, saying ""No more war"", would have gotten purged from VK in recent days. Sounds like Ovi is truly between a rock and a hard place.Here's the Outlook article in its entirety:https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/04/russian-social-media-ukraine-vk-propaganda/",CapsFan75,2022-03-06 18:02:00.332,0,True,0,[]
1,"Yeah worrying about Ovechkin's family is cringe. Please, stop saying that. His lack of condemnation says a lot. He is more than likely indifferent or slightly in favor of the invasion, or we have to at least take it that way in this situation. The NHL should ban Russian players, it might make things more simple and take the pressure off. Because it's not going to get better, unless we're all just going to give them a pass and forget about it. Russian athletes in America are a big propaganda piece for Putin's agenda abroad, and banning them sends a very clear message that he can't have his Motherland represented here while he does what he does.And I say this as someone who wants nothing more but to see the Caps do well in the playoffs after watching pretty much every game this year.

27,"We all know that Ovi is one of four Russian players on the Caps roster now, along with Orlov, Kuzy and Sammy.  Additionally, Alex Alexeyev is playing in Hershey and likely will be a Cap in the coming seasons.  This situation will affect most, if not all of them. Of course, Ovi is the one with the biggest spotlight on him because he's the greatest Russian player since Kharlamov, and certainly is the greatest Russian player to ever play in the NHL.  Along with that, he's been a supporter of Putin to some degree (as has Malkin and some others).  Whether or not his support was coerced or deliberate we don't know.  We do know what he said in his comments, and that he is against the war. He specifically said ""No more war.""In Russia, on their media, they aren't even calling it a war.  No idea how that's playing over there. Ovi's in a tough spot right now as well, in that his family are still in Russia, where they were when their trip to the All-Star game was cancelled due to his illness.  His wife and his two children are still over there.  They can certainly travel back to the USA, although they're going to have to go the long way, likely via China or via another country Asia, since US and Canadian airlines can't fly to Russia, and Aeroflot can't fly to the US right now.  A charter plane might be able to go, but again, it would have to go via an Asian route.  If they wanted to go commercially, China Air is still flying Moscow-Beijing on a daily basis.  There is one advantage that he has though, in that Ovi's kids are American citizens, since they were both born here in the USA. So the US Embassy in Moscow can help them get transit if need be.  Ovi though, knows he has many other family members in Russia, and he probably knows that Putin is not someone you want as an enemy (he knows what went on with Panarin, he certainly doesn't want that happening to himself.) He's doing the right thing in keeping a low profile and playing the game he loves. Once this crisis is over (hopefully soon), things will get more back to normal for him.

But at the end of the day, I can't place hardly any blame on Ovi (nor, for that matter, probably 95% or more of the Russian people) for the war in Ukraine when it's pretty damn obvious we're dealing with a psychopath.

39,"I do not want to get into this, because I am too stupid to have a real great take. But I will give my dumb 2 cents: 1. I have seen Ovechkin do great things on and off the ice for almost 2 decades. I do not know him personally, but have followed his public life for my entire adult life. He has made the NHL 100s of millions of dollars, entertained all of us, and did it all being a fun and great dude. Helping homeless guys get jackets, donating tons to underprivileged children's charities, making the end of a cancer ridden kids life awesome (and scoring a fucking hat trick for him). That does not go away because his politics stink. 2. His allegiance to Putin is bad to all of us because we are able to look at the situation more objectively than he ever has. If I was Ovi, would I have stayed away from the president who ran my country when I was considered Russian royalty myself? My answer to that question is emphatically: no clue. I have no idea what I would do. If I had to guess, I would probably be in the same position as Ovi. It is so easy for me to pontificate about how good I am and how I would never. But given what Russia is, I cannot sit here with a straight face behind a keyboard and yell about how I WOULD NEVER DO WHAT OVI DID. I wish I could easily say I would not, but I what taught different in school, I grew up without as much propaganda around me as he probably did. Who knows how I would have thought if I was him?3. I know a lot of people that if people on here knew their politics, they would wonder why I would ever consider them a friend. But they are great people with views I dislike. Putin is more harmful than that, I can understand that, but I also know great people with bad politics. And those great people think differently than I do, but they are also kind, sweet humans. I have zero idea how I would actually handle the situation. I am extremely (EXTREMELY) biased here, but I view this on the 17 years of on-and-off-the-ice Ovi I have seen rather than the politics of the guy. My allegiance changes zero percent when watching Ovi. And when he scored last night, as a human trying to even somewhat understand what he has been through the past week+, I actually got a little emotional for him.

So, when he eclipses Jagr, perhaps just a golf clap rather than full throated applause or booing.  For now.

How much of his personal life is intertwined with his public persona we don't know.

That's not enough. Period. Not enough. It may not be the the pro-Putin position its made out to be but its not nearly enough.

And they will be replaced by other bad evil MF’s. (today would have been Lou Reed’s 80th btw - oh, not that he was one, he wrote about them)From my pov, Ovie is not a bad evil MF. He is in the orbit of at least one though.He has no real power to make change. I think a lot of people rely on others to make change - the post here about talking about the boss publicly and privately is in a way an example of that. Ovie is visible, so he is there to be seen.  Practically no one can see me, for example.So if Ovie can’t make change (my personal assumption), then is he aiding and abetting?My opinion - I don’t think so, he’s just a useful person to an evil person.

Being photographed with Putin, or doing what Putin wants, is understood very differently there. Even Slava Malamud, who’s made a career out of criticizing Ovi, cautions that in Russia, everyone who’s met Putin (athletes, singers, actors) seems to put a picture of him/her and Putin on social media, even those who don’t endorse (and may hate) his behavior. It’s a way of bragging about how important you are. In the USA, someone wearing a MAGA hat is actively taking a political position, because there a more than one political party. In Russia, the president is simply the boss, not even taking into account that he’s a murderous gangster. If your brother works for Amazon, he may say glowing things about Jeff Bezos on TV, and he may pose in photos grinning with Bezos in a photo, but when it’s just the two of you in a room, he might tell you he thinks the guy is a prick.
