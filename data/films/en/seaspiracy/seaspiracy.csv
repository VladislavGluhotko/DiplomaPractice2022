If a few major countries (USA, Canada, etc.) truly wanted to end their reliance on China it would be devastating to the country and with 1.3 billion people living in a crumbling economy and no prospects I can promise you the Chinese government would start a war or threaten war. Basically just like North Korea. They launch missiles just to strong arm countries into sending them aide. China would be that x1000. 

Not to say every other country is clean, but China alone makes a MASSIVE impact on the environment and shutting them down would do wonders for healing mother Earth. The issue is who is actually going to stop doing business with China? And how would China survive if they had to stop doing all the things that cause the pollution in the first place?

Here’s unsolicited advice. Extract what’s helpful or think of it as a helpful message to others just stating out:

Eat more of the veggies, greens, grains and fruits that you are already accustomed to, and gradually introduce new items to proliferate the new gut microbiomes which help break down the fiber; this is to avoid bloating that many people experience initially upon sudden influx of fiber. For recipe ideas, install the apps such as Fork-over-knives, 21 Day Kickstart from PCRM, Dr Michael Greger’s DailyDozen recipes, as well as consult pages like this, online and YouTube. The Happy Cow app shows where the nearest vegan restaurant in your area is. Initially, don’t venture too far on empty stomach whereby you find yourself in weak moments and succumbing to the aromas emanating from the animal products; take some healthy snacks with you. Make sure to supplement with vitamin b12, d3 if you don’t get enough sunshine every day, a third of a teaspoon of the iodized salt if you don’t eat seaweeds, as well as flaxseeds, hempseeds, walnuts and chia seeds for your omega 3s. Due to the concept of calorie density, and if you go whole-food plant-based like me, you can have as many servings of soups, salads and curries until you feel full , and will have ingested less calories than an order or two of chicken nuggets. For a healthful education, you can follow the following on the YouTube: Drs Michael Klaper, Milton Mills, Michael Greger, Kim Williams, John McDougal, William Li, Esselstyn, T Colin Campbell, John Furman, Neal Barnard, Will Bulsiewicz as well as the dietitian Lee Crosby and Mic the Vegan, amongst many others.",2021-04-01 06:34:48.948229,19,False,0,[]

853,aureliusVA,False," @Rich O  you need to do your research into the sustainability of egg-laying marine fish. Their sustainability is off the charts. In theory two fish of certain species could repopulate the entire species at its current stock levels in 15 months.  That's how voracious most egg-laying marine fish are. 

So when you talk about what these other scientist and what they have said you're going to have to quote them directly so that I can refute that or agree with it directly.

The sustainability of fish stocks is a very manageable thing but the things that affected are more than just fishing. You have to look at fish like migratory Birds because if you destroy a breeding ground or a feeding ground or a place where they feel safe they will simply go somewhere else or die. Coastal development and factory farming have done more to damage fish stocks than actual fishing

The debris fisherman might leave behind and that's a Mite because that shit cost money is nothing compared to the amount of garbage Americans throw on the ground every day and the amount of plastic pollution put into the ocean by 8 rivers in Asia.

You don't have to interact, just more info the better. People still see a vegan diet is more expensive, it just depends on what kind. If you were a junk food vegan, then yes that can be, if you go for the mock meat (fake) options in the supermarket, yes that can be, but if you stick to a wholefoods plant based diet it as cheap if not cheaper, especially if you use dried legumes.

1181,Alto Burger,False," @gamwpanagia  The main reason have higher rates of cancer now is because we live longer. Just a few generations ago our average lifespan was about 20 years less than it is now. Go back even even longer and our average lifespan decreases even further. Yes, the things we eat and consume can be carcinogenic to some extent (example - red and processed meat is so carcinogenic, there's more cancerous cells in a Big Mac than there are in half a packet of cigarettes), but modern medicine has vastly extended our lifespans making it much more likely to get cancer before we die. 
Also, if everyone became vegan, we'd free up a landmass the size of Africa and stop more greenhouse gases entering our atmosphere than all the world's transportation systems combined. A cow eats 7 times it's own weight before it's slaughtered. Meat is the least sustainable food source we have and if the human population continues to grow at this extent, the price of meat will be so expensive in 100 years the average person won't be able to afford it because demand will outweigh the ability to supply.

1184,The Opinionist High Quality Opinions,False," @Alto Burger  Your comment is beyond belief. Where did you get your information? From the New King of Ag, Bill Gates?
    Funny (ironic), that The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are now the largest owners of private farmland in the United States, coming in at 268,984 acres. It couldn't possibly be a question of Gates the Eugenicist and his Foundation pushing plant and cellular based alternatives to meat because that will make them tons of money? It couldn't possibly be be because meat is full of things that, without added chemicals, are good for the body and BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, especially? Of course not!! They're the good guys, right? They aren't the people who want us to eat plants and fake meat only, in order to make us less healthy and especially, less intelligent. If our brains and intellects function too well, we just might catch on to the depopulation agenda that's been rolling out since the 1960s and is hitting us now, full force.
   How did I know that this ""documentary"" about very serious and important subjects that have been exposed for at least twenty years now, would end up pushing fake seafood, made out of plants? I knew because Netflix is ""Propaganda Central"" and if a PROGRAM didn't end up programming its audience to act in a way that makes money for Global Ag and both makes us less intelligent and easier to control, well... it wouldn't be Netflix, would it?!!
   Don't get me wrong. I haven't eaten meat myself for a long time, have no agenda of my own, and know that many of the subjects covered in this piece are of great importance. I am one of those people though, who study before I speak and who is determined to do EVERYTHING I can to thwart the bastards who are pushing their own self serving messages to the gullible public. My graduate school thesis was a study of the physiological changes in the Italian population between 1945 and 2010. Do you know what the main factor was that accounted for the incredible rise in both height and IQ in Italy? It was the economic growth that allowed the majority of the population to begin eating meat on a regular basis.

Multiple studies have SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN that the consumption of red meat - especially processed meat - causes cancer and dementia. Scientsts from the University of Leeds research groups just released a report on the links to dementia. Experts from the International Association for Research on Cancer have ruled red meat as a ""Probable Carcinogen"". The International Agency for Research on Cancer also found that eating anymore than 50g of processed meat per day increases the risk of bowel cancer by 18%.

There is zero evidence concluding any of these things are good for the body or ""brain development"". More spew the dairy and meat industries pump out in an attempt to attack the plant based industry.... Every single study I have read on meat consumption (hundreds of them) that state meat has any positive effect on the human body were ALL sponsored by MEAT AND DAIRY INDUSTRY companies. Funny, huh? You want to talk about completely baseless BS like rumors about what Bill Gates is doing when there is physical evidence of  the meat and dairy industry releasing false reports in an attempt to damage the plant based industry? How about this... If you were supposed to eat meat... like if it was really good for you, why don't you go and throw a piece of raw chicken in the sun for a couple of days and then eat it raw without cooking it at all? Ya know... seeing as though us humans are ""supposed"" to eat meat... you'll be able to consume it without any problems just like any other meat eating animal could 

And even if Bill Gates was doing what you said - all the power to him! If he can get even richer by abolishing a murderous industry that profits from death - all the power to him. You honestly have a problem with someone making money off saving lives and reducing the carbon footprint of an entire industry and reducing the need to slaughter innocent animals for nothing other than your tastebuds?

1.) Fish being gone by 2048 was based on a 2006 research paper that has since then have been found not accurate by later studies. The researchers did not intentionally mislead people with their study, they just used the wrong metric. 

2.) MSC is paid off by the fishing industry. This part is a bit fishy. MSC claims that their certifications are carried out by accredited 3rd party bodies. However, you can still get the certification even if you use long line fishing and trawling, which is known to be destructive to sea animals and coral reefs. It seems like MSC's bar is set fairly low that most fisheries can get the certifications. Ineligible fisheries are ones that use poison or explosives to fish, slaves, shark fin violation, etc. 

3.) Some of the people interview have later claimed that their interview was taken out of context. Christina Hicks doesn't give too much information after her initial tweet.

Once broken or damaged they too release sap, resin, tanin, etc., to save themselves from bacterial infection. They too are trying to survive. Basic instinct of every living thing. It’s just that they are not that good at convincing humans. They can’t show pain. So humans really don’t empathise with them.

It plays out like a trailer as opposed to an engrossing exposé. Maybe it's this current generation who can accept such shallow documentary making. Who knows. 

Ali, the documentary maker, is a vegan, as is his entire family. My concern with this current vegan trend is the push for synthetic highly processed genetically engineered ""meat"" based alternatives, and the increase and acceptance for GM agriculture. If you're not familiar with glyphosphates, then educate yourselves. 

All this documentary did was leave me feeling that there is an undercurrent agenda at play, that perfectly suits the current anti meat pro vegan narrative. 

There is nothing wrong with veganism. There is however, in my opinion, grave concerns about GM agriculture, the long term effects from it on our health, and the effects of it on our ecosystem and ecology. 

Huge geo engineering multinational corporations are behind the majority of the current ""plant"" based movement and push.

Some industries eager to earn money and power often overrules the effort to do things sustaianble.

A big portion of it, especially in Europe, is highly regulated and in many way, not always, big highly at large, is sustaianble.

But since the goal of the vegans behind the doc is not to say people should not eat that kind of fish, but this kind of fish from these areas and countries instead of the bad once, they instead paint a picture as if people should not eat fish at all. And that is wrong, in my eyes

Also there are frequent discounts in Lidl for all kind of fish and I am not talking about the cheapest brands. It costs 1 euro for 80 grams net weight - enough for a dinner with a salad. Imagine that there are just 1000 tuna fishes left in the ocean - it would be stupid unlikely for all the fishing boats to find just a single tuna fish in a day this way. 
Keep in mind the ocean is also producing CO2 and it's quite a producer - the movie also misleads with this!

How much CO2 does the ocean produce?
While previous estimates put the ocean sink at around 2bn tonnes of CO2 per year, we find that it could be 0.8-09bn tonnes larger.

The mixed plastic is almost impossible to recycle because way different properties. Another source is the really dumb environment people, who push the biodegradable plastic. They do not understand, it is made form same gas/oil as regular plastic. The small amount additive turns it to micro plast within short time. It pollutes all the water on entire earth. The result is 100% same as pouring the oil down. Nobody (good person) does not pour oil to the nature but green people push that biodegradable so much. My suggestion is next, stop mixing and tax mixed plast, no more biodegradable and the end consumer plast packaging should be from the same plastic (family). Example most of the end consumer plastic can be easily from polyethylene - low density-, medium density, high density or very high density (LD-PE, MD-PE, HD-PE or VHD-PE).

He’s talking to all these random people in the fish industry, clearly trying to get a reaction like he’s a part of TMZ “Why do you support overfishing and killing the planet?

It just seems unnecessary to force the interest on your audience like this on top of the crazy edited and zoomed shots (which by the way is so distracting when you’re trying to watch anything in general).

As for bycatch, it sold in low price so people buy to make side dishes like fry and other stuff. As for fish population, govt impose measures to prevent boats to go out to sea during the season when they produce egg. Because of that fish population didn't hit hard. Since there a law for all vessels that enter countries water to be registered or notify the coast guard, we have no problem with foreign vessel illegally entering our waters like how Chinese enter African and South American countries illegally.

If 50 of the world did it wouldn't fix 50% of this problem.
The shark fins are a small amount of a shark that is going to only the very wealthy that are in very few numbers and that alone is a problem.
If fish stop being eaten it is more likely to create more uneaten rotting fish.
The reason is because it is money driving it, money will sort ways to get these things being brought through other methods of a pull for empathy when fishermen families suffer and become poor.
This is the issue with money driving things.
The solution is trying to end the money system and bartering systems because money is that sort of system already with money as the scapegoat as well as the slave master.
The whole thing about an ecosystem is that every part came to be by the balance of biological harmony.
In the same way salmon is painted is the same way this is painted in some small ways to make a bigger impact and this is the issue with getting down to the main cause.
This itself had to generate money to be able to get this far to be seen.
In selling things it's all about telling most of the truth but keep making this truth be the better truth which means some sort of bell and whistle... 
I was a full vegan and found that it doesn't help in the long run on the bigger issues much like the way plastic was seen to be from fishing and if fish doesn't have money then it's like to suddenly make more pollution because those nets are all no longer needed and it will cost too much money to throw them away in the proper menas and boom... more pollution.
Even though many fews can not just do this many fews knowing that the solution means changing the entirety of how to run and work needs to change and holding on to that point might see it.
This ends the need to not eat meat.... and in that breath like something else in the film where they disagreed with chicken being the same... this solution will be for people who are not vegan or vegetarian just eat more meat... 
There more to this and it's to do with how we do things as a species more than as individuals... but we also do need to do our best as individuals also because that will safeguard this cause. more than say, being complacent... as, integrity breeds integral surroundings.
Also saying is about what we do as individuals will breed a lot of who is better or being better than this person and so forth....
We give our rubbish to a company, it is the company that will put it in the sea to save money not us.
We have plastic, because cleverly, we need most of everything made...
If we all decided to only eat things that came without plastic there wouldn't be enough food and all a lot of food rotting in plastic that would go to the companies that would pollute.
The system needs to stop what comes to us and not us to try to boycott it with our own buying... that wouldn't work as the buying and selling system isn't that simple.",2021-05-01 06:35:48.070395,0,True,1,[2244]

So when you have one person conducting all of these interviews with his partner, while filming he is bound to build a narrative and adhere to it, instead of finding new information as no one agreed to speak to him and there was  no nuances nor factual information given out. This whole thing was based on “what ifs” and mind you this is Seaspiracy documentary not mostly facts. He had fact littered through out the documentary, mind you facts that any one could look up. It’s not like multiple people were conducting the scheduling of interviews. Plus keep in mind that in order to understand what is going on a lot better people must conduct investigations which might take over a year to find records and evidence and put them together and then step back and analyze their findings based on fact. Plus you have to consider that all of this has to be “what if’s” at a point due that 80 percent of planet life is in the ocean and we have only discovered  thirteen percent of ocean life.

And assuming the African population is not at all affected by commercial fishing (as per your logic of having no ""data""), the fact that giant companies are allowed to even fish near African coasts is unfair to the native population, they should be the ones fishing there if at all. A man asking for food to these giant ships is not really an indication of their progress.
Moreover, I really don't think that the interview with a slave in Thailand was fake.
The importance of marine biology is already been studied a lot, way before this documentary was made. So the point that most of the carbon is captured in sea is well studied already.

One interviewee says ""My associate can't have said to eliminate fish"", the guy says she did, she says ""no, there is no way she said to ELIMINATE FISH"", then he cuts to her saying to ""eliminate or reduce your intake of fish"", which is a completely different thing. The documentary then leaves it as that, as if they made a point or something. The interview itself becomes completely irrelevant and any useful information that could have been gotten out of it is lost. 
He ""sneaks up"" on a fishery and HAPPENS to discover that it's a big tuna fishery. As if that information is not readily available on google. 

The documentary should have focused more on the facts that fishing gear is the greatest part of plastics in the oceans, that dolphins are being killed in attempts to increase the number of fish in the sea, that overfishing is a huge issue....

2667,Curtis006,False," @Link  where to even begin? The film (I won’t call it a “documentary”) is nothing more than a propaganda piece for veganism, as are the director’s previous two films I’ve since found out. I haven’t seen these previous two films, but it seems as though they have the exact same faults, and have been called out as such, from what I’ve read. It blatantly and obviously twists facts and selectively edits its interviews with leading questions to suit the narrative it already pre-determined, and does so shamelessly. It engages constantly in this hackneyed sensationalism and overdramatization. You could almost watch it as a parody. There were moments that were so obviously staged and being sold by the director so poorly that for a moment I questioned whether it was all a Netflix April fool’s joke. There are, no doubt, a lot of problems in this industry. And I actually agree with the film’s main concluding thesis: that a social shift towards eating less meat, including fish, collectively, would be of tremendous benefit to the environment and our future. But I fear this film is such an embarrassment that it will hinder that goal rather than help it for years to come. You can’t get to the world you want by lying and tricking people.

2669,Sarah,False," @Curtis006  You said nothing of substance, you just complained that they ""dramatized"" it. The stats may have been incorrect in some cases, but it is also not possible to know whether stats are truly correct. As a meat and fish eater I fully agree with the message of this documentary and plan on switching to veganism. It is pure hypocrisy to claim to care about the planet and people while arrogantly dismissing this documentary just cause it promotes veganism ?? How ridiculous. Veganism obviously does good for the environment and people. The sole complaint I saw from ""experts"" is that this documentary tells everyone to stop eating fish and it's not thinking about the poor. This is wrong because it clearly showed how indeginous African populations are struggling to eat and find fish because of commercial and illegal fishing, both markets are heavily unregulated and in fact impossible to regulate as you cannot control what happens at sea. This documentary was directed at an audience that isvprivileged enough to afford a Netflix membership and the devices to watch it, they sure as hell can stop consuming commercial fish.",2021-04-01 06:36:07.080597,0,False,0,[]
2670,Kees Stijne,False, @Sarah  indigenous African populations struggle to eat and find fish because they themselves use illigal fishing methods and do not adhere to maximum sustainable yield levels set by fishing institutes.

Many experts on this subject (university professors, certification NGO's, ecologists) have spoken out against this film. And don't claim that large seafood has the whole world bribed, I'm a marine bioloFist and have not seen any money.

Nobody wants bycatch but there are rules, especially for certification, that try to prevent this from happening. It's a difficult industry, so is all of agriculture, but criticizing NGO'S that try to improve this is not beneficial. I can guarantee you that they ship is not MSC certified.

2676,Sarah,False," @Kees Stijne  You are literally dismissing so many things with pure dishonesty. With sustainable fishing you are ultimately still killing more, no matter how nice you paint it to be. It is also inherently cruel towards fishes and other sea animals who are proven to feel pain and fear. You might as well call it ""sustainable slaughtering"", these two words are oxymorons. This documentary takes a standpoint where it takes into account the actual pain and cruelty inflicted on animals, and that's totally valid. You could hear the whales screaming in pain when getting killed. If you don't care, just admit it instead of portraying this documentary as terribly dangerous when it fact veganism is the least harmful thing for the planet and the beings living in it. And please, these EU regulations are meaningless, they cannot and don't control what happens at sea. These labels are all for show and profit, anyone with half a brain knows that.",2021-05-01 06:36:07.381490,0,False,0,[]
2677,Kees Stijne,False," @Sarah  I care a lot for animals, but the world you paint is black and white. These labels are not for show and profits for the organization that runs them is literally a non-profit organization. You have to start somewhere with sustainability, and veganism is a great place to do so. But veganism is in it self not sustainable, at least not for the vast majority of the world who cannot afford it. But anything taken out of context can be cruel to animals or people alike. Slavery also exists in coffee and chocolate, deforestation for soy and advocado, even the killing of millions of rats and mice to keep grain silos pest free. Does this mean that we should stop eating those products? No, we have to try and find products made in a sustainable fashion. The same is true for seafood and animal production. I am not advocating that there is not a lot wrong in the industry, but punishing those that try to make a difference is counterproductive.

Look at what positives the seafood industry has done, it has transformed one of the poorest states in Vietnam to one of the richest. It has provided micronutrients to the malnourished people of South-Sudan. Lionfish hunting is saving the reefs of Bonaire. When care is taken, the industry can get results for a brighter future, but when left unchecked can do devastating damage. 

Agriculture and fishing is a very difficult industry to understand and regulate. Most people have no idea how it works and thus criticism is easily done, but few offer actual solutions. And those that do should not be burned by a film such as this.",2021-05-01 06:36:07.383509,0,False,0,[]
2678,Sarah,False," @Kees Stijne  It's so naive of you to think that non-profits are honest, there's so much corruption out there and in case you didn't notice some of these organization  in the documentary have been literally created and funded by corporations running the fishing industry. It's a very common practice in all industries, not just in fishing, to create organizations and bribe audits and certification providers in order to validate their clearly unethical practices. And I don't know about you but I never heard a vegetable scream in pain while being peeled and cut. There's a lot of unfair practices regarding the vegetables and fruits industries but it is not hard to get around that by buying local which is often far cheaper, and growing your own veggies too. However fishing will always remain an obscure and cruel industry no matter how ethical you try to make it,  animals are suffering regardless. Also transparency in terms of the vegan industry is far easier to have, but when it comes to the fishing industry, you simply cannot know what goes on at sea. And after seeing the unnecessary mass slaughter of sea animals, slavery and indigenous populations being deprived of their own resources, I don't think this industry should be supported any longer, that's what this documentary literally advocates for and it is absolutely correct in my view.",2021-05-01 06:36:07.385513,0,False,0,[]

What about the UN's standard development goals? 

You can call me naive all you want but you are starting to sound like a conspiracy theorist... All the experts out there are advocating for change in the seafood industry, me included, but this film does not do the change that has already happened and the people fighting for a better future justice.
