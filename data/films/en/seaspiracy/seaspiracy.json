A relative of mine, and a very experienced diver, told me how his diving buddy was almost killed himself when he became entangled in ghost fishing nets in the ocean.

That's why the world is becoming a shitty place. Nobody cares about their shit. Unfortunately, everybody else has to suffer for that. People with lots of egos, no empathy, and humility to consider even the facts about the horrible suffering of others. The insane part is they themself want empathy, respect, and all the good things for themselves and their families.

Extract what‚Äôs helpful or think of it as a helpful message to others just stating out:\n\nEat more of the veggies, greens, grains and fruits that you are already accustomed to, and gradually introduce new items to proliferate the new gut microbiomes which help break down the fiber; this is to avoid bloating that many people experience initially upon sudden influx of fiber. For recipe ideas, install the apps such as Fork-over-knives, 21 Day Kickstart from PCRM, Dr Michael Greger‚Äôs DailyDozen recipes, as well as consult pages like this, online and YouTube. The Happy Cow app shows where the nearest vegan restaurant in your area is. Initially, don‚Äôt venture too far on empty stomach whereby you find yourself in weak moments and succumbing to the aromas emanating from the animal products; take some healthy snacks with you. Make sure to supplement with vitamin b12, d3 if you don‚Äôt get enough sunshine every day, a third of a teaspoon of the iodized salt if you don‚Äôt eat seaweeds, as well as flaxseeds, hempseeds, walnuts and chia seeds for your omega 3s. Due to the concept of calorie density, and if you go whole-food plant-based like me, you can have as many servings of soups, salads and curries until you feel full , and will have ingested less calories than an order or two of chicken nuggets. For a healthful education, you can follow the following on the YouTube: Drs Michael Klaper, Milton Mills, Michael Greger, Kim Williams, John McDougal, William Li, Esselstyn, T Colin Campbell, John Furman, Neal Barnard, Will Bulsiewicz as well as the dietitian Lee Crosby and Mic the Vegan, amongst many others.", "time": "11 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥", "time_parsed": 1617248088.948229, "author": "Al Lee", "channel": "UCVF8baElO9Mu8AwqXxnoPeA", "votes": "19", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQCt6FBC6yIaUoXwM8OFZfwdr0_Gh54RQW6gA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You have to look at fish like migratory Birds because if you destroy a breeding ground or a feeding ground or a place where they feel safe they will simply go somewhere else or die. Coastal development and factory farming have done more to damage fish stocks than actual fishing\n\nThe debris fisherman might leave behind and that's a Mite because that shit cost money is nothing compared to the amount of garbage Americans throw on the ground every day and the amount of plastic pollution put into the ocean by 8 rivers in Asia.

I would start joining some wholefood vegan Facebook groups. You don't have to interact, just more info the better. People still see a vegan diet is more expensive, it just depends on what kind. If you were a junk food vegan, then yes that can be, if you go for the mock meat (fake) options in the supermarket, yes that can be, but if you stick to a wholefoods plant based diet it as cheap if not cheaper, especially if you use dried legumes. It takes a little while to get used to making the effort with soaking and cooking but it's  definitely cheaper and healthier. Follow people on Instagram and check out Pinterest, amazing recipes. Just start to educate yourself now, then in time you'll have all the knowledge to, when allowed, make your own meals. You maybe able to educate your family in time.

Just a few generations ago our average lifespan was about 20 years less than it is now. Go back even even longer and our average lifespan decreases even further. Yes, the things we eat and consume can be carcinogenic to some extent (example - red and processed meat is so carcinogenic, there's more cancerous cells in a Big Mac than there are in half a packet of cigarettes), but modern medicine has vastly extended our lifespans making it much more likely to get cancer before we die. \nAlso, if everyone became vegan, we'd free up a landmass the size of Africa and stop more greenhouse gases entering our atmosphere than all the world's transportation systems combined. A cow eats 7 times it's own weight before it's slaughtered. Meat is the least sustainable food source we have and if the human population continues to grow at this extent, the price of meat will be so expensive in 100 years the average person won't be able to afford it because demand will outweigh the ability to supply.\nIt's ironic that you'd be against veganism, but call someone else \"intellectually lazy\".

From the New King of Ag, Bill Gates?\n    Funny (ironic), that The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are now the largest owners of private farmland in the United States, coming in at 268,984 acres. It couldn't possibly be a question of Gates the Eugenicist and his Foundation pushing plant and cellular based alternatives to meat because that will make them tons of money? It couldn't possibly be be because meat is full of things that, without added chemicals, are good for the body and BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, especially? Of course not!! They're the good guys, right? They aren't the people who want us to eat plants and fake meat only, in order to make us less healthy and especially, less intelligent. If our brains and intellects function too well, we just might catch on to the depopulation agenda that's been rolling out since the 1960s and is hitting us now, full force.\n   How did I know that this \"documentary\" about very serious and important subjects that have been exposed for at least twenty years now, would end up pushing fake seafood, made out of plants? I knew because Netflix is \"Propaganda Central\" and if a PROGRAM didn't end up programming its audience to act in a way that makes money for Global Ag and both makes us less intelligent and easier to control, well... it wouldn't be Netflix, would it?!!\n   Don't get me wrong. I haven't eaten meat myself for a long time, have no agenda of my own, and know that many of the subjects covered in this piece are of great importance. I am one of those people though, who study before I speak and who is determined to do EVERYTHING I can to thwart the bastards who are pushing their own self serving messages to the gullible public. My graduate school thesis was a study of the physiological changes in the Italian population between 1945 and 2010. Do you know what the main factor was that accounted for the incredible rise in both height and IQ in Italy? It was the economic growth that allowed the majority of the population to begin eating meat on a regular basis.\n    That is EXACTLY what the Eugenics cult doesn't want- people who are strong and most of all, people who can think.", "time": "11 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥", "time_parsed": 1617248103.180722, "author": "The Opinionist High Quality Opinions", "channel": "UCuOxteOpg39NOGVUYurCd3Q", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTFaApWHR2XYSFNXbmTHseCdnjGtZIA0u0zOdVmgQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Scientsts from the University of Leeds research groups just released a report on the links to dementia. Experts from the International Association for Research on Cancer have ruled red meat as a \"Probable Carcinogen\". The International Agency for Research on Cancer also found that eating anymore than 50g of processed meat per day increases the risk of bowel cancer by 18%.\n\nThere is zero evidence concluding any of these things are good for the body or \"brain development\". More spew the dairy and meat industries pump out in an attempt to attack the plant based industry.... Every single study I have read on meat consumption (hundreds of them) that state meat has any positive effect on the human body were ALL sponsored by MEAT AND DAIRY INDUSTRY companies. Funny, huh? You want to talk about completely baseless BS like rumors about what Bill Gates is doing when there is physical evidence of  the meat and dairy industry releasing false reports in an attempt to damage the plant based industry? How about this... If you were supposed to eat meat... like if it was really good for you, why don't you go and throw a piece of raw chicken in the sun for a couple of days and then eat it raw without cooking it at all? Ya know... seeing as though us humans are \"supposed\" to eat meat... you'll be able to consume it without any problems just like any other meat eating animal could \n\nAnd even if Bill Gates was doing what you said - all the power to him! If he can get even richer by abolishing a murderous industry that profits from death - all the power to him. You honestly have a problem with someone making money off saving lives and reducing the carbon footprint of an entire industry and reducing the need to slaughter innocent animals for nothing other than your tastebuds? \n\nPut the crack pipe down and perhaps go back and finish school...

He lived because the divers he dived with, risked their own lives to saving him. And yet, this is what the commercial fishing industry is doing every day to our marine wildlife, plants and ocean corals.

MSC claims that their certifications are carried out by accredited 3rd party bodies. However, you can still get the certification even if you use long line fishing and trawling, which is known to be destructive to sea animals and coral reefs. It seems like MSC's bar is set fairly low that most fisheries can get the certifications.

Some of the people interview have later claimed that their interview was taken out of context. Christina Hicks doesn't give too much information after her initial tweet. \n\n4.) Seaspiracy highlights Japanese and Chinese fisheries as well as Thai ones too. These are the worst in the industry. USA, Norway, and other European countries are much better regulated in comparison. Their points aren't wrong, but they are taking the worst fisheries to represent a whole. \n\nAfter making these points, I'm still not going to eat fish since, by catch of dolphins, over fishing, environmental impact of fish farms, trawling killing environment, etc are all real issues portrayed accurately in this film.", "time": "10 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥", "time_parsed": 1619840119.318667, "author": "Ben", "channel": "UCeVzfBDsDITcY4aXhXLLZZQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRuk88aanFMT1LPIq_FHYKUPfddLb3UVgHNOOj0Jg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It plays out like a trailer as opposed to an engrossing expos√©. Maybe it's this current generation who can accept such shallow documentary making. Who knows. \n\nAli, the documentary maker, is a vegan, as is his entire family. My concern with this current vegan trend is the push for synthetic highly processed genetically engineered \"meat\" based alternatives, and the increase and acceptance for GM agriculture. If you're not familiar with glyphosphates, then educate yourselves. \n\nAll this documentary did was leave me feeling that there is an undercurrent agenda at play, that perfectly suits the current anti meat pro vegan narrative. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with veganism. There is however, in my opinion, grave concerns about GM agriculture, the long term effects from it on our health, and the effects of it on our ecosystem and ecology. \n\nHuge geo engineering multinational corporations are behind the majority of the current \"plant\" based movement and push. \n\nTo any vegans that are reading this message, if you're following veganism, please make sure you're following a healthy vegan diet. Your choices in the products and items that you choose to consume will have an immense impact on health and ecology, therefore choose wisely. Choose natural.

The plastic industries does not produce the recyclable plastics thanks for mixing. This is the source why recycling numbers are so low. The mixed plastic is almost impossible to recycle because way different properties. Another source is the really dumb environment people, who push the biodegradable plastic. They do not understand, it is made form same gas/oil as regular plastic. The small amount additive turns it to micro plast within short time. It pollutes all the water on entire earth. The result is 100% same as pouring the oil down. Nobody (good person) does not pour oil to the nature but green people push that biodegradable so much. My suggestion is next, stop mixing and tax mixed plast, no more biodegradable and the end consumer plast packaging should be from the same plastic (family). Example most of the end consumer plastic can be easily from polyethylene - low density-, medium density, high density or very high density (LD-PE, MD-PE, HD-PE or VHD-PE). No need to send to customer PP, PS and other very different plastics. Only what we lose is the nice shiny print on the products.

This whole thing was based on ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and mind you this is Seaspiracy documentary not mostly facts. He had fact littered through out the documentary, mind you facts that any one could look up. It‚Äôs not like multiple people were conducting the scheduling of interviews. Plus keep in mind that in order to understand what is going on a lot better people must conduct investigations which might take over a year to find records and evidence and put them together and then step back and analyze their findings based on fact.

The guy is way too aggressive about his ways, and any time he has an interview he obviously cuts and edits to make it seem like he's getting the responses he wants. \nOne interviewee says \"My associate can't have said to eliminate fish\", the guy says she did, she says \"no, there is no way she said to ELIMINATE FISH\", then he cuts to her saying to \"eliminate or reduce your intake of fish\", which is a completely different thing. The documentary then leaves it as that, as if they made a point or something. The interview itself becomes completely irrelevant and any useful information that could have been gotten out of it is lost. \nHe \"sneaks up\" on a fishery and HAPPENS to discover that it's a big tuna fishery. As if that information is not readily available on google. \n\nThe documentary should have focused more on the facts that fishing gear is the greatest part of plastics in the oceans, that dolphins are being killed in attempts to increase the number of fish in the sea, that overfishing is a huge issue.... But instead it's just a cringe worthy attempt at creating \"action\" out of nothing. \n\nI hope other higher quality documentaries are made on this issue.", "time": "10 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥", "time_parsed": 1619840149.339603, "author": "xxxx85", "channel": "UC9REhERy9Fyns1tR63YJ0iQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQyFdtJVs-lrp_NgnP3rgBALmCvJ-if5uaq8Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It blatantly and obviously twists facts and selectively edits its interviews with leading questions to suit the narrative it already pre-determined, and does so shamelessly.

These labels are not for show and profits for the organization that runs them is literally a non-profit organization. You have to start somewhere with sustainability, and veganism is a great place to do so. But veganism is in it self not sustainable, at least not for the vast majority of the world who cannot afford it. But anything taken out of context can be cruel to animals or people alike. Slavery also exists in coffee and chocolate, deforestation for soy and advocado, even the killing of millions of rats and mice to keep grain silos pest free. Does this mean that we should stop eating those products? No, we have to try and find products made in a sustainable fashion. The same is true for seafood and animal production. I am not advocating that there is not a lot wrong in the industry, but punishing those that try to make a difference is counterproductive.\n\nLook at what positives the seafood industry has done, it has transformed one of the poorest states in Vietnam to one of the richest. It has provided micronutrients to the malnourished people of South-Sudan. Lionfish hunting is saving the reefs of Bonaire.

It's a very common practice in all industries, not just in fishing, to create organizations and bribe audits and certification providers in order to validate their clearly unethical practices. And I don't know about you but I never heard a vegetable scream in pain while being peeled and cut. There's a lot of unfair practices regarding the vegetables and fruits industries but it is not hard to get around that by buying local which is often far cheaper, and growing your own veggies too. However fishing will always remain an obscure and cruel industry no matter how ethical you try to make it,  animals are suffering regardless. Also transparency in terms of the vegan industry is far easier to have, but when it comes to the fishing industry, you simply cannot know what goes on at sea. And after seeing the unnecessary mass slaughter of sea animals, slavery and indigenous populations being deprived of their own resources, I don't think this industry should be supported any longer, that's what this documentary literally advocates for and it is absolutely correct in my view.", "time": "10 –º–µ—Å—è—Ü–µ–≤ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥", "time_parsed": 1619840167.385513, "author": "Sarah", "channel": "UCVKpvNqA3p4iWeEZYrIFQXA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTXJ3UG57Lw4-MiXlpojvBgc3yQzH968Dg8-5fW-g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
